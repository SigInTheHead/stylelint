stylelint configuration.

These are my personal preferences, and were created to save me copy and pasting my `.stylelintrc` to each new project.

#Installation
`npm install -D tmo-stylelint`

# Usage
In the `.stylelintrc` file update the extends property to 
```json
{
  "extends": "tmo-stylelint"
}
```

I personally have the above as the entire contents of my `.stylelintrc` file
